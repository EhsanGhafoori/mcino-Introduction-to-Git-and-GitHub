## Important Notes

1. **Make sure your repository is PUBLIC** - Private repositories cannot be accessed by graders
2. **Verify all URLs work** - Click each URL to ensure it opens the correct file
3. **Check file paths** - The paths above are common React project structures, but adjust if your files are in different locations:
   - `src/` folder structure
   - `components/` or `Components/` folder
   - `store/`, `redux/`, or `slices/` folder for Redux files
4. **Branch name** - If your files are on a different branch (not `main`), replace `main` with your branch name (e.g., `master`, `develop`)
5. **File extensions** - Make sure the file extensions match exactly (`.jsx`, `.css`, `.md`)
